## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

I have learned to use chart.js Library to create bar chart, that was new experience, also i have learned to interact wit JSON file.


### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) - This Chart.js Documentation helped me to style my bar chart. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/ai/ai_chartjs.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally to know there is library for different chart. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
